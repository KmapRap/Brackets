        <h2>Reading books!!</h2>
        <p>Reading is a good source of entertainment.Fact books are packed to the edge of the page with facts and fiction is packed with fun, joy and often magic. I got my love reading at the age of 5 years old. I have loved reading boooks ever since</p>

        <p>My favourite books are <i>Eragon, Harry Potter and Percy Jackson</i> (not necessarily in that order). If you haven't read them, they all are <b>MAGICAL</b> and <i>Percy Jackson</i> has <i>Greek Gods</i>, <i>Eragon </i> has <i>Dragons, Shades, Ra'zac and many more</i> and <i>Harry Potter</i> has simple <b>Magic</b>. </p>

    <p>
        My favourite Authors are the writers of my Favourite books: Rick Riordan; Christopher Paolini; Joanne K. Rowling. I like J.K. Rowling because she used her ingenuity and experience to create <i>Harry potter</i>, Rick Riordan because, though he based his five books on the <i>Harry Potter </i> series, he ade it come out <i>so</i> different from the <i>Harry Potter </i> series, it is hard to belive he based <i>Percy Jackson</i> on them!! and Chris because even after he had to do brutal re-writes of <i>Eragon</i> 50 times he finally pulled it off in the end!!</p>
